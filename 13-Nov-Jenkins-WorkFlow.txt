Yesterday's session : Jenkins workflow in Realtime
-----------------------------------------------------

-> As a developer, we will send an email to git admin team to create repository for our project. All developers will keep project source code in git repository.

-> After Git repository got created, we will send an email to DevOps team to create jenkins jobs for our project.

-> In Realtime, project contains multiple environments like below

	a) local env
	b) dev env
	c) qa env (Quality Assurance)
	d) uat env (user acceptance testing)
	e) pilot env (pre production)
	f) prod env (Live env)

-> Our system is called as local env where we will do development and we will perform Unit Testing of our code.

-> After unit testing is completed our code should be moved to Git repository.

Note: All the developers code will be integrated in git repository.

-> All the developers code will be deployed to DEV env

-> All the developers are responsible to test their code in DEV env. That is called as Developer Integration Testing (DIT).


-> After DIT is completed, our application will be deployed into QA env so that testers will test our application.

-> After QA testing is completed, application will be deployed into UAT env so that client will test our application

-> After UAT testing is completed, application will be deployed into Pilot env. (Pilot is called as Pre-Prod env)

-> After Pilot testing is completed, applicatio will be deployed into Prod env. Production env is called as Live environment.
